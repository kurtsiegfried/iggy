//! File descriptor transfer between shards.
//!
//! After shard 0 accepts or connects a TCP socket and completes the
//! handshake, it calls [`dup_fd`] to create a second kernel reference
//! to the same socket. The duplicated fd is wrapped in an owning
//! [`DupedFd`] and sent to the target shard via the inter-shard channel.
//! The target shard calls [`wrap_duped_fd`] to construct a compio
//! `TcpStream` on its own runtime.
//!
//! Shard 0 then drops its original `TcpStream`, closing its fd. The
//! socket stays alive because the duplicated fd still references it
//! in the kernel's file table.
//!
//! [`DupedFd`] closes the underlying fd on drop, so a `ShardFrame`
//! discarded mid-flight (shutdown, pump drain abort, router panic
//! before `install_*_fd`) does not leak the dup.
